# AWSwift
A Native Swift 3 SDK for AWS Services, for use both on device and on servers! Supports iOS, macOS, tvOS and Linux.

## Aims

We believe that Swift has the potential to be everywhere - from running the applications on your mobile devices, to powering backends on servers and everything from scripting to websites in between. AWS is the most popular cloud computing provider and in order for us to be able to interact with it on any platform we need a native SDK. Whether it be deploying EC2 instances from scripts, to interacting with massive DynamoDB databases, we want AWSwift to do it all!

The list of AWS services we currently support are:
* DynamoDB
